# Kazoo Webphone library v2.0

The goal of this library is to turn the browser in a softphone, using the correct protocol depending on the browser used by the client. On supported browsers, the goal is to allow calls using WebRTC, ~~and to fall back on the RTMP
protocol if WebRTC is not supported by the browser.~~

The default export of [libwebphone.js](src/libwebphone.js) is a class that provides all access to the libraries functionality for an instance of a specific configuration.

## Quick Start

1. Include the libwebphone build artifact

```
         <script src="dist/libwebphone.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

2. Create an instance, providing a configuration object with all the minimal parameters for the features you require. A "simple kitchen sink" example might look like:

```
         <script type="text/javascript">
            var config = {
            dialpad: {
               renderTargets: ["dialpad"],
            },
            callList: {
               renderTargets: ["call_list"],
            },
            callControl: {
               renderTargets: ["call_control"],
            },
            mediaDevices: {
               renderTargets: ["media_devices"],
            },
            audioContext: {
               renderTargets: ["audio_context"],
            },
            userAgent: {
               transport: {
                  sockets: ["wss://sip.websocket.server"],
               },
               authentication: {
                  username: "sip_username",
                  password: "sip_password",
                  realm: "sip_realm",
               },
            },
            }; //End ofConfig

            var webphone = new libwebphone(config);
            webphone.getUserAgent().start();
         </script>
```

This assumes the HTML body will contain empty elements with the IDs "dialpad", "call_list", "call_control", "media_devices", "audio_context" and "user_agent" where the corresponding default elements should be generated by libwebphone.

The library provides multiple ways to interact with it. The above example will render the default templates with the default configuration. However, a developer can:

- Change the behavour via configuration alone (very extensive options)
- Render multiple and different but syncronized templates for any component
- Fully customize any/all component template(s)
- Use static HTML elements with event handlers to trigger appropriate libwebphone methods. For example, the following onClick action for an HTML element representing the number 1 button on a dialpad `webphone.getDialpad().dial('1');`.
- Complete programatic actions. For example, an onClick action for a "Contact 2600Hz" button `webphone.getUserAgent().call('+14158867900');`
- Purely event driven user experiences
- Change the internationalization via configuration
- Replace the internationalization engine
- Minimize the build or remove functionality by disabling unused classes
- Multiple instances of libwebphone on the same page, with different configurations
- A mix of any of these patterns!!!

## Components

The phone funtionality is implemented by classes that encapsulated the logic for a particular component, those are:

- [lwpUserAgent](docs/lwpUserAgent.md) : Provides all features for managing connecting and maintaining the SIP connection over websockets.
- [lwpMediaDevices](docs/lwpMediaDevices.md) : Provides all features for discovering and selecting the media device (microphone, camera and audio output destination)
- [lwpAudioContext](docs/lwpAudioContext.md) : Provides audio generation (ringing, DTMF playback, ect) as well as audio routing / mixing options
- [lwpCallList](docs/lwpCallList.md) : Provides a list of all active calls and allowes the user to switch between them
- [lwpDialpad](docs/lwpDialpad.md) : Provides all features for collecting the target (dialed number) for new calls, transfers and in call DTMF
- [lwpCallControl](docs/lwpCallControl.md) : Provides all call control features such as hold, mute, transfer, redial, ect

Each of these clases can be disabled via configuration (or modified build) if the provided functionality is not required or desired.

Internally, all calls are represented as an instance of the [lwpCall](docs/lwpCall.md) class.

> NOTE! Each of these classes is not expected to be created outside of the main libwebphone instance and are accessable using methods of the main instance or by consuming events.

#### Methods

##### renderAddTarget(config)

Will add a new render target which will be automatically updated based on the component and the provide configuration object (as described above).

##### render(premodifier, postmodifier)

Will re-render all render targets. Premodifer is a function that is provided with the render configuration of a render target prior to updating the root element. Postmodifier is a function that is provided with the render configuration after a root element is updated. This function returns an array of all render configurations updated.

## i18n

Internationalization of the built in templates, or optionally utilized by custom templates, are loaded with language 'bundles' by each class instance during startup. These bundles are loaded with a namespace for that class. The default library used is [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) but it is hoped that then implementation is generic enough to allow replacment with a prefered library or an existing on an a website.

For details of what translations are currently available see the individual class documentation "i18n" section.

## Configuration

| Name         | Type   | Default | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userAgent    | object | {}      | See [lwpUserAgent configuration](docs/lwpUserAgent.md#configuration)       |
| mediaDevices | object | {}      | See [lwpMediaDevices configuration](docs/lwpMediaDevices.md#configuration) |
| audioContext | object | {}      | See [lwpAudioContext configuration](docs/lwpAudioContext.md#configuration) |
| callList     | object | {}      | See [lwpCallList configuration](docs/lwpCallList.md#configuration)         |

| call         | object | {}      | See [lwpCall configuration](docs/lwpCall.md#configuration)                 |

## Events

All events produced by libwebphone are emitted with a minimum of two parameters. The first is always the instance of libwebphone and the second is the instance of the class producing the event. For example, the first two parameters of the event "mediaDevices.created" are the libwebphone instance and the lwpMediaDevices instance. Further, all events are in dot notation beginning with the emitting class "name". In the above example, "mediaDevices.created" was emitted by lwpMediaDevices.

Some events provide more parameters and are detailed on the corresponding documents as "Additional Parameters". This column is a comma sepearted list of arguments that are present after the libwebphone and producing class instance parameters.

At any given time only one instance of a call (lwpCall) will be the primary (current user selected call). When the primary lwpCall instance emits events they will be published with the normal prefix "call." as well as with "call.primary.".

Further, all events are emitted using [EventEmitter2](https://github.com/EventEmitter2/EventEmitter2) which according to their documentation:

> In addition to having a better benchmark performance than EventEmitter and being browser-compatible, it also extends the interface of EventEmitter with many additional non-breaking features.

Some of these additional features include events when listeners are added / removed, wildcard bindings and functions such as `waitFor(event, timeout)` or `onAny(listener)`. See the documentation for EventEmitter2 for details.

### Emitted

| Event                 | Additional Parameters        | Description                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| created               |                              | Emitted when all required classes have been instantiated |
| language.bundle.added | language (string), bundle () | Emitted when a new language bundle is added              |
| language.changed      | translator (function)        | Emitted when the translator function is ready or changed |

### Render

The library uses a bespoke solution to render HTML elements, implemented in [lwpRenderer.js](src/lwpRenderer.js). Components that extend this class have the common configuration option `renderTargets` which is expected to be a list of strings, assuming each to be the ID of a existing HTML element. Additionally, the component will have two additional methods detailed below.

This render engine is simple, lightweight and functional. While suited to production environments larger implementations may choose to leave the `renderTargets` unconfigured and build deeper (more suited) integrations with their framework of choice. If you would like to share your implementation for your favorite framework we would welcome that pull-request! :)

To keep the render engine simple, every render fully replaces all elements previously rendered (`render.root.element.innerHTML = render.html;`). This can cause issues if external scripts or libraries are attempting to interact with the generated HTML elements. However, the most common use-cases for such interaction can be achieved via proper configuration of the built in render engine.

For advanced configuration rather than providing a renderTarget as a string, or when using the `renderAddTarget(config)` below, advanced functionality can be achieved by providing the following configuration:

| Name           | Type        | Description                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| template       | string      | A [mustache](https://github.com/Mustache/Mustache) template.                                                          |
| i18n           | object      | A dictionary of names to be used in the template to namespaced i18n keys                                              |
| root.elementId | string      | The id of an existing element to be used as the root of the render (if no root.element is provided)                   |
| root.element   | HTMLElement | The HTML element used as the root of the render, found via `document.getElementById(root.elementId)` if not provided. |
| by_id          | object      | An object that provides parameters for elements in the template that work via element ids                             |
| by_name        | object      | An object that provides parameters for elements in the template that work via element names                           |

If no template is provide in a render configuration the default template of the component is used, these are detailed on the documentation for the component.

The `by_id` object properties will expose a pre-configured or uniquely generated if not provided, element id to the template. In addition, optional event handlers can be configured for each element and bound using the results of `getElementById(id)`

The `by_name` object works exactly as `by_id` except it uses `getElementsByName(name)`.

For example, consider the following render configuration:

```javascript
{
   "template":"{{^data.call.hasSession}} <button id=\"{{by_id.redial.elementId}}\"> {{i18n.redial}} ({{data.redial}}) </button> {{/data.call.hasSession}}",
   "root":{
      "elementId":"redial_button"
   },
   "by_id":{
      "redial":{
         "events":{
            onclick: (event) => {
              const element = event.srcElement;
              element.disabled = true;
              this.redial();
            },
         }
      }
   }
}
```

When rendered this will replace the inner HTML of an element on the document with the id "redial_button" with the result of rendering the template.

The `i18n` properties used in the template are the currently translated language strings for that component and provided automatically. By default each component has a unique list (see the component's i18n documentation) but can be changed in the render configuration. For example, if the configuration contained the following `'i18n': { 'foobar': 'libwebphone:callControl.foobar' }` the template could reference `{{i18n.foobar}}` and it would be the string from the i18n bundles in the current language. If a render config sets the i18n option those will be the only translated strings available to template altho it can redefine and extend the existing default dictionary if access to the default translations are required. Further, and non-default i18n keys will need to be added by external sources to the language bundles.

The `data` properties are similarly automatic and unique to the components. Each `data` property is a clone of the current configuration agumented with real-time data as required (see the component's documentation for template data definitions). In our example, we assume it the component will provide `data.call.hasSession` as a boolean determining if the current call has a session. This is used to hide the redial button when the call is active. Futher assumed the component is providing `data.redial` which is the last dialed number.

The template also uses `{{by_id.redial.elementId}}`. It is possible to configure the render with a static id for the redial button using the configuration `'by_id': { 'redial' : { 'elementId': 'static_id'}, 'events': { ...} }`. However, if missing a unquie id will be generated. For the element in the template that is using the id any events are bound. This is accomplished by using the property name of the events to add a callback function. In this example, it will add a 'onclick' handler to the element using the id generated for the "redial" object.
