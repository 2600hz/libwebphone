# Kazoo.js library v2.0
The goal of this library is to turn the browser in a softphone, using the correct protocol depending on the browser used by the client. On supported browsers, the goal is to allow calls using WebRTC, ~~and to fall back on the RTMP
protocol if WebRTC is not supported by the browser.~~


More documentation coming soon, but developers can currently reference the initProperties functions to view available configuration properties.


## Contact
