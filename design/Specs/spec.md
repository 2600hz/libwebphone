## Webphone

## Overview
### Terminology
_2600hz:_ We are an open-source organization building large scale telecommunications software to disrupt the industry.

_Kazoo:_ This is our platform which provides telecommunications services.  Available to everyone on [github](https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo), 2600hz also offers a hosted Kazoo service.

_Kazoo API:_  The Kazoo platform exposes REST HTTP interfaces for configuration, call control, maintenance, and integration.

_Webhooks:_ The Kazoo platform has the capability, if configured, to issue requests to a HTTP server when specific events happen.  For example, it could be configured to issue a HTTP GET request to "http://myserver.com/new_call.php?call_id=1234&caller_id=4158867900&..." whenever a new call in a given account is placed.

_MonsterUI:_ This is a new framework developed by 2600hz to run Kazoo specific javascript web-applications.  The framework is built around an "App Store" concept, which includes everything from a browser based phone to a PBX UI.

_UI Application:_  This is a packaging of javascript, css, html, and other assets that can be installed into MonsterUI to provide functionality to end users.  This document may simply refer to this as the application.
